# LangLunches

Hi! Welcome to LangLunches: (informal) biweekly talks by PhDs and postdocs in the LST department at UdS, to promote collaboration and the exchange of ideas between the various groups in the department. 

Every two weeks, two speakers give a ~10-15 minute talk on their recently-submitted or in-progress research, with time in between for lunch (bring-your-own-lunch), questions, and socializing:

```
Talk 1: 10 - 15 minutes
Break 1: 15 - 20 minutes
Talk 2: 10 - 15 minutes
Break 2: 15 - 20 minutes
```

## When and where?

Wednesdays 12:00 - 13:00 (biweekly), Building A2.2, Room 2.13
